 🛡️ Task: Setup and Understand the Role of VPNs in Protecting Privacy and Secure Communication

 🎯 Objective
To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect user privacy and secure online communication by encrypting traffic and masking the real IP address.

 🪜 Steps Followed

 🧩 Step 1: Download ProtonVPN
- Visited [ProtonVPN Official Website](https://protonvpn.com/download).  
- Downloaded the "ProtonVPN Windows Installer (.exe)" file.

 ⚙️ Step 2: Install the VPN
- Located the file in the "Downloads" folder.  
- Double-clicked `ProtonVPN-win.exe` to launch setup.  
- Clicked "Next → Install → Finish" to complete installation.  

 🔐 Step 3: Log In to ProtonVPN
- Opened the ProtonVPN app.  
- Logged in using the "registered email and password".  
- Verified email (if prompted) before logging in.

 🌍 Step 4: Connect to a VPN Server
- From the main dashboard, selected a "Free Server" (e.g., 🇳🇱 Netherlands).  
- Clicked "Connect" and waited until the "green shield" appeared showing “Connected”.

 🧾 Step 5: Verify VPN Connection
- Opened [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
- Checked that the "IP address and country changed", confirming VPN protection.

 🌐 Step 6: Test Secure Browsing
- Visited several websites to ensure smooth, encrypted browsing.  
- Observed secure HTTPS connections while VPN was active.

 🔄 Step 7: Disconnect VPN
- Clicked "Disconnect" in ProtonVPN.  
- Re-verified real IP address and compared browsing speed (slightly faster without VPN).

 🧾 Observations
- IP address successfully changed after VPN connection.  
- Browsing became encrypted and private.  
- Noticed a slight decrease in speed while VPN was active.

 🔐 VPN Benefits
✅ Encrypts all data traffic using "AES-256 encryption".  
✅ Hides real IP and location from websites and ISPs.  
✅ Protects against hackers on "public Wi-Fi" networks.  
✅ Prevents online tracking and enhances anonymity.  
✅ Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.

⚠️ VPN Limitations
⚡ Free plans have limited bandwidth and server choices.  
📉 Connection speed may drop slightly due to encryption.  
📄 Some free VPNs may store logs — always check "privacy policy".  

---

 🧠 Learning Summary
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a "secure encrypted tunnel" between a user’s device and the internet.  
It ensures that sensitive information, browsing history, and location remain "private and protected" from hackers, ISPs, and surveillance tools.
