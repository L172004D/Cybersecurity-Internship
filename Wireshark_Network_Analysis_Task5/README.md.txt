 Task 5 - Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

 🎯 Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark and identify common network protocols.

 🧰 Tools Used
* Wireshark
*Ping Command / Web Browser

 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Started Wireshark and selected the active network interface.
2. Captured live packets while browsing websites and pinging servers.
3. Applied filters for `HTTP`, `DNS`, and `ICMP` protocols.
4. Stopped capture and saved `.pcap` file.

 🔍 Protocols Identified
| Protocol | Description | Observation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| DNS | Resolves domain names to IP addresses | Observed queries to Google DNS |
| HTTP | Web communication | Detected GET requests to websites |
| ICMP | Network connectivity test | Ping packets between client & server |

 📊 Key Learnings
- Understood how each protocol operates at packet level.
- Learned to apply filters for protocol-specific inspection.
- Gained confidence in network monitoring using Wireshark.
