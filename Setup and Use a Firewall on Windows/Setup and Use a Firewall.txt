 🧱 Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall (Windows)

🎯 Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules using "Windows Defender Firewall" to allow or block specific network traffic.

 ⚙️ Tools Used
 🪟 "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security"  
 💻 Command Prompt (Telnet test)  

 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Opened "Windows Firewall" via `wf.msc`.  
2. Listed current "Inbound Rules".  
3. Created a rule to "block Telnet (port 23)".  
4. Tested with  
   `cmd
   telnet localhost 23
`

➤ Connection blocked ✅
5. Added a rule to "allow SSH (port 22)".
6. Removed the test block rule to restore the original configuration.

 📄 Deliverables

* 📘 "Firewall_Config_Report_Windows.pdf"
* 🖼️ Screenshot 1 – Block Telnet rule
* 🖼️ Screenshot 2 – Telnet test result
* 🖼️ Screenshot 3 – Allow SSH rule

 🔒 Summary

This task demonstrates how "Windows Firewall" filters inbound and outbound network traffic using rule-based control.
By blocking and allowing specific ports (e.g., 23 for Telnet, 22 for SSH), we can secure the system against unauthorized access and ensure safe communication.
