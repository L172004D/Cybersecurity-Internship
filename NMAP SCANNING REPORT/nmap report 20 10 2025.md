 Nmap Network Scan Report — [MY_IP]

Scan date: 2025-10-20  
Target scanned: [MY_IP]   
Scanner: Nmap 7.98 (Zenmap screenshot supplied)

 1) Quick summary
- Host: [REDACTED_IP] (MAC vendor: Shenzhen Skyworth Digital Technology — likely ISP router/modem)
- Open TCP ports discovered: "53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 7443 (oracleas-https), 8080 (http-proxy)"
- Packet capture evidence: HTTP traffic observed from [REDACTED_IP] to external IP (msdownload Windows update requests shown in Wireshark screenshots)


 2) Detailed findings
| Port | Proto | Service (nmap label) | Likely purpose / notes |
|------|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 53   | tcp   | domain               | DNS service — router often runs DNS forwarder or resolver. If open on WAN, this is a risk. |
| 80   | tcp   | http                 | Web management interface or HTTP proxy / captive portal. Check web UI. |
| 443  | tcp   | https                | HTTPS web UI or management portal. Should be checked for valid cert, auth. |
| 7443 | tcp   | oracleas-https       | Alternate HTTPS port commonly used by OEM device admin consoles or proxies. Investigate service banner. |
| 8080 | tcp   | http-proxy           | Proxy or secondary web UI; often used for admin panels or local web services. |

Note: All listed ports were reported `open` in your Nmap output screenshot.

 3) Wireshark observations (from provided screenshots)
- Capture shows "HTTP GET" traffic for Microsoft update '.cab' files — this looks like a Windows host ([MY_IP]) retrieving updates from an external Microsoft server (146.75.122.172). This is normal update behavior.
- Packets shown are HTTP/1.1 with `Connection: Keep-Alive` and `User-Agent: Windows-Update-Agent/...` — indicates legitimate Windows Update client traffic.
- No immediate malicious patterns visible in provided frames; the capture demonstrates normal client -> external update server flows, not router management traffic.

 4) Risk assessment (quick)
- "Low / Normal": HTTP traffic for Windows updates from client host — expected and benign.
- "Medium": Open management ports (80/443/8080/7443) on the router/modem are common but should be secured. Risks increase if:
  - The management interface is exposed to WAN/Internet.
  - Default or weak credentials are used.
  - The device firmware is out-of-date (known CVEs).
- "Medium/High": DNS (port 53) open on the router can be normal for a resolver, but if it’s accepting recursive queries from the Internet it can be abused (DNS amplification DDoS). Confirm scope (LAN-only vs WAN-exposed).

 5) Prioritized next steps (recommended — do in this order)
1. "Identify who is running each service"
   - From a machine on the LAN, test web UI: `http://[MY_IP]` and `https://[MY_IP]:7443` and `http://[MY_IP]:8080` in a browser (use caution if on production). Note what UI appears and if login is required.
2.Run targeted Nmap service/version detection
   - "sudo nmap -sS -sV -p 53,80,443,7443,8080 [MY_IP] -oN host_192-168-31-1.txt"
   - This identifies application/service names and versions so you can check for known vulnerabilities.
3. Run safe NSE scripts for discovery (read-only)
   - "sudo nmap -sS -sV --script=http-title,http-headers,banner -p 80,443,7443,8080 [MY_IP]"
   - For DNS: `sudo nmap -sU -p 53 --script=dns-recursion,dns-cache-snooping [REDACTED_IP]` (UDP scan — be cautious and run during low activity).
4. Check whether management is exposed to WAN
   - From your ISP router admin page, check remote management / remote administration settings and disable remote/WAN management unless you explicitly need it.
5. Check credentials & firmware
   - Change default admin password if still default. Update router firmware from vendor/ISP.
6. Harden services
   - Disable unused services (e.g., proxy or alternate admin ports if unnecessary).
   - Enable HTTPS with valid cert if you must expose a web UI; prefer LAN-only access and restrict via firewall.
7. Monitor / capture more if needed
   - Capture a short pcap while you access the router UI to confirm what endpoints the UI communicates with and whether auth strings are protected (do not capture credentials in plaintext unless you have permission and a controlled lab environment).
8. Document & remediate
   - Save findings, versions, remediation steps in your repo (CSV/Markdown). Use `-oA` to store Nmap outputs.


 9) What to avoid / legal & safety notes
- Do not run intrusive or exploit scripts on devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test; running vulnerability or exploit scripts against ISP equipment may violate terms of service.
- When scanning UDP (DNS) or running scripts, prefer non-peak hours to avoid impacting services.
- Be careful when capturing traffic — packet captures can include sensitive data from other hosts.
